## Texts
#### Required:
- [Introduction to Logic Design](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/introduction-logic-design-marcovitz/M9780073191645.html), by Alan B. Marcovitz,  McGraw- Hill,3rd Edition, 2010.

## Course Overview
At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Design, build, debug, and demonstrate the operation of arbitrarily complex synchronous ma- chines given a reasonable problem statement.
2. Set criteria to determine the “best” design and select the best design from the created designs.
3. Describe the operation of an elementary microprocessor.
4. Create an instruction set for an elementary microprocessor, and enter the instruction set into the processor’s instruction PROM.
5. Enter a program in the processors memory and execute the program.

## Grading 
|   |  Distribution | 
|:----:|:---------:|
|Lab Report| 25%|
|  Assignment   | 10%    |
|   Quizzes  |   15%  |
|  Capstone Project   |  10%  |
|  Midterm   |   20%  |
|  Final Exam   |   20%  |


- For the letter grade check [syllabus](bmoraffa.github.io).
- I will not curve, but I will provide a lot of opportunities to earn extra credit. 
- **Extra Points**: I need volunteers to take notes each class, type it up and send it to me so it can be uploaded for the entire class. Each student can scribe at most 2 lectures.

The scribe notes should be written in prose English, as if in a textbook, so that someone who did not attend the class will understand the material. Please do your best, as it is good practice for communicating with others when you write papers in the future.

## Exercises
Assignments should be submitted in class on due date before the lecture starts. No late assignment will NOT be accepted unless it was permitted by the instructor.
