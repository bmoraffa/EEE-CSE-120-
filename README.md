## Communication
- We use both [canvas](https://canvas.asu.edu) and [course website](https://github.com/bmoraffa/EEE-CSE-120-Fall2020) for announcement and notes. All students must regularly check these websites for update. 
- If there is a question as to lectures that you need to ask the professor, contact him directly through his email. The subject of the email must be as follows: **EEE/CSE 120: T TH (time of your class)**. If you use different title your email will go to spam. 

## Texts
#### Required:
- [Introduction to Logic Design](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/introduction-logic-design-marcovitz/M9780073191645.html), by Alan B. Marcovitz,  McGraw- Hill,3rd Edition, 2010.
#### Recommended:
- [Contemporary Logic Design](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Katz-Contemporary-Logic-Design-2nd-Edition/PGM13030.html), by Randy H. Katz and Gaetano Borriello, Pearson, 2nd Edition, 2004.

## Course Overview
At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Design, build, debug, and demonstrate the operation of arbitrarily complex synchronous ma- chines given a reasonable problem statement.
2. Set criteria to determine the “best” design and select the best design from the created designs.
3. Describe the operation of an elementary microprocessor.
4. Create an instruction set for an elementary microprocessor, and enter the instruction set into the processor’s instruction PROM.
5. Enter a program in the processors memory and execute the program.

## Grading 
|   |  Distribution | 
|:----:|:---------:|
|Lab Report| 25%|
|  Assignment   | 10%    |
|   Quizzes and Attendence |   15%  |
|  Capstone Project   |  10%  |
|  Midterm   |   20%  |
|  Final Exam   |   20%  |


- **ATTN:** In addition to scheduled quizzes we will have pop-quizzes. 
- For the letter grade check [syllabus](bmoraffa.github.io).
- I will not curve, but I will provide a lot of opportunities to earn extra credit. 
- **Extra Points**: I need volunteers to take notes each class, type it up and send it to me so it can be uploaded for the entire class. Each student can scribe at most 2 lectures.
- Incorrect Work & Correct Answer = NO CREDIT.
- No Work & Correct Answer = NO CREDIT.

The scribe notes should be written in prose English, as if in a textbook, so that someone who did not attend the class will understand the material. Please do your best, as it is good practice for communicating with others when you write papers in the future.

## Exam
All quizzes and exams are closed book, closed notes but you will be allowed one hand-written, double-sided cheat sheet. To get full credit, you must attend the exams. No makeup quizzes or exams will be given unless the instructor excuses the absence.
